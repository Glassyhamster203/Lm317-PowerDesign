# Simple Linear Power Supply Based on LM317 and LM358

This is a simple linear power supply design based on **LM317** and **LM358**, combined with **PWM DAC** and **ADC** for precise control. It is specifically designed for the **National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest (NUEDC)** by the **HFUT (Hefei University of Technology)** team.

## Key Features
- **LM317** for stable voltage regulation.
- **LM358** for efficient operational amplification and signal processing.
- **PWM DAC** for digital voltage control.
- **ADC** for real-time voltage and current feedback.
- Simple and reliable structure, ideal for competition requirements.

## Applications
- Suitable for small-scale linear power supply development in laboratories.
- Designed for NUEDC-related projects and prototype research.
